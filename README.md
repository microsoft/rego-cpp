# `rego-cpp`

This project is an effort to create a C++ interpreter for the OPA policy language,
[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). Our goal is
to build both a standalone executable and a library such that programmers who are working
in C++ can interpret Rego programs natively. To achieve this we are building our
interpreter on top of the experimental term rewriter
[Trieste](https://github.com/microsoft/trieste).

> **Warning**
> While this project has progressed to the point that we support full Rego language
> (see [Language Support](#language-support) below) we do not support all built-ins.
> That said, we have verified compliance with the OPA Rego test suite. Even so, it
> should still be considered experimental software and used with discretion.

## Getting Started

Start by installing [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in the way appropriate for your
environment.

### Linux

Create a build directory and initialize the cmake project:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. --preset release-clang

You can then build and run the tests using:

    ninja install
    ctest

### Windows

Create a build directory and initialize the cmake project:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. --preset release

You can then build and run the tests using:

    cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
    ctest -C Release

### Using the `rego` CLI

The interpreter tool will be located at `build/dist/bin/rego`. Here are
some example commands using the provided example files and run from the suggested
`dist` install directory:

    ./bin/rego -d examples/scalars.rego -q data.scalars.greeting
    "Hello"

    ./bin/rego -d examples/objects.rego -q data.objects.sites[1].name
    "smoke1"

    ./bin/rego -d examples/data0.json examples/data1.json examples/objects.rego -i examples/input0.json  -q "[data.one, input.b, data.objects.sites[1]]"
    [{"bar": "Foo", "baz": 5, "be": true, "bop": 23.4}, "20", {"name": "smoke1"}]

    ./bin/rego -q "5 + (2 - 4 * 0.25) * -3 + 7.4"
    9.4

    ./bin/rego -d examples/bodies.rego -i examples/input1.json -q data.bodies.e
    {"one": 15, "two": 15}

You can run the test driver from the same directory:

    ./bin/rego_test tests/regocpp.yaml

### Using the `rego` Library

See the [examples](examples/README.md) directory for examples of how to use the
library from different langauages.

## Language Support

At present we support v0.55.0 of Rego as defined by OPA, with the following grammar:

```ebnf
module          = package { import } policy
package         = "package" ref
import          = "import" ref [ "as" var ]
policy          = { rule }
rule            = [ "default" ] rule-head { rule-body }
rule-head       = ( ref | var ) ( rule-head-set | rule-head-obj | rule-head-func | rule-head-comp )
rule-head-comp  = [ assign-operator term ] [ "if" ]
rule-head-obj   = "[" term "]" [ assign-operator term ] [ "if" ]
rule-head-func  = "(" rule-args ")" [ assign-operator term ] [ "if" ]
rule-head-set   = "contains" term [ "if" ] | "[" term "]"
rule-args       = term { "," term }
rule-body       = [ "else" [ assign-operator term ] [ "if" ] ] ( "{" query "}" ) | literal
query           = literal { ( ";" | ( [CR] LF ) ) literal }
literal         = ( some-decl | expr | "not" expr ) { with-modifier }
with-modifier   = "with" term "as" term
some-decl       = "some" term { "," term } { "in" expr }
expr            = term | expr-call | expr-infix | expr-every | expr-parens | unary-expr
expr-call       = var [ "." var ] "(" [ expr { "," expr } ] ")"
expr-infix      = expr infix-operator expr
expr-every      = "every" var { "," var } "in" ( term | expr-call | expr-infix ) "{" query "}"
expr-parens     = "(" expr ")"
unary-expr      = "-" expr
membership      = term [ "," term ] "in" term
term            = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | membership | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr
array-compr     = "[" term "|" query "]"
set-compr       = "{" term "|" query "}"
object-compr    = "{" object-item "|" query "}"
infix-operator  = assign-operator | bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator
bool-operator   = "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | ">=" | "<="
arith-operator  = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
bin-operator    = "&" | "|"
assign-operator = ":=" | "="
ref             = ( var | array | object | set | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr | expr-call ) { ref-arg }
ref-arg         = ref-arg-dot | ref-arg-brack
ref-arg-brack   = "[" ( scalar | var | array | object | set | "_" ) "]"
ref-arg-dot     = "." var
var             = ( ALPHA | "_" ) { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
scalar          = string | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
string          = STRING | raw-string
raw-string      = "`" { CHAR-"`" } "`"
array           = "[" term { "," term } "]"
object          = "{" object-item { "," object-item } "}"
object-item     = ( scalar | ref | var ) ":" term
set             = empty-set | non-empty-set
non-empty-set   = "{" term { "," term } "}"
empty-set       = "set(" ")"
```

Definitions:
```
[]     optional (zero or one instances)
{}     repetition (zero or more instances)
|      alternation (one of the instances)
()     grouping (order of expansion)
STRING JSON string
NUMBER JSON number
TRUE   JSON true
FALSE  JSON false
NULL   JSON null
CHAR   Unicode character

```

### Builtins

At the moment only support a few builtins, but are actively working on adding
all the standard builtins. The following builtins are currently supported:

- `aggregates`
- `arrays`
- `bits`
- `casts`
- `encoding`
- `graphs`
- `numbers`
- `objects`
- `regex`
- `semver`
- `sets`
- `strings`
- `types`
- `units`
- miscellaneous
    * `opa.runtime`
    * `print`
    * `time.now_ns`

### Compatibility with the OPA Rego Go implementation

Our goal is to achieve and maintain full compatibility with the reference Go
implementation. We have developed a test driver which runs the same tests
and validates that we produce the same outputs. At this stage we pass all
the non-builtin specific test suites, which we clone from the
[OPA repository](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/main/test/cases/testdata).
To build with the OPA tests available for testing, use one of the following presets:
- `release-clang-opa`
- `release-opa`

At present, we are **NOT** passing the following test suites in full:
- `crypto*`
- `glob*`
- `graphql`
- `invalidkeyerror`
- `json*` (except `jsonbuiltins`)
- `jwt*`
- `net*`
- `planner-ir`
- `providers-aws`
- `time`
- `walkbuiltin`
