# Changelog

## [2023-07-11 - Version 0.2.2](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.2)
Adding the `in`, `if`, `contains`, and `else` keywords.

**New Features**
- Added future keyword support to the runtime
- Added `in`, `if`, `contains`, and `else` keywords to the runtime
- Added partial set rule construction
- Added partial object rule construction

**Bug fixes**
- Else rule bodies were not previously handled correctly when the else keyword
  was omitted. This has been fixed.
- `ExprCall` nodes can now (correctly) be a `RefHead`.

**Improvements**
- Function calls are now represented interally via a `ExprCall` node as opposed to
  a `RefArgCall` node, to better reflect the target grammar.

## [2023-06-27 - Version 0.2.1](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.1)
Addressing various minor improvements, bugs, and documentation issues.

**Bug fixes**
- Fixed a segfault when an input, data, or module file did not exist
- Fixed a segfault when a lookdown returns zero definitions
- Fixed various typos and errors in the documentation
- Fixed a potential infinite rewrite loop in the RuleBody pass

**Improvements**
- Rule values will no longer always be `UnifyBody` nodes but will be `Term` nodes
  in cases when the rule returns a constant value.
- The code now uses the well-formed child indexing wherever possible for increased
  robustness.


## [2023-06-21 - Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
