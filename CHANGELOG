# Changelog

## [2023-08-12 - Version 0.2.4](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.4)
Adding a test driver that can execute OPA Rego-style YAML test files against the
`regocpp` interpreter.

**New Features**
- The `rego_test` driver is a tool that can process OPA Rego-style test case YAML files.

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed an issue with assignment of arrays and objects to local variables.

**Improvements**
- All existing tests have been converted to use the test driver

## [2023-08-08 - Version 0.2.3](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.3)
Adding the remainder of the missing language features, bringing the implementation fully
compliant with the published v0.55.0 grammar.

**New Features**
- Array, Set, and Object comprehensions
- `every` keyword
- `import` support
- `with` keyword
- Basic built-in framework in place. Added some builtins as well:
  * `print`
  * `startswith`
  * `endswith`
  * `count`
  * `to_number`
  * `union`
  * `intersection`
- `bin-infix` support
- `ref` package names

**Bug fixes**
- Nested enumeration was not working properly. This has been fixed.

**Improvements**
- Turning on unification logging can be done on the command line (no recompile needed)
- Passes have been broken out for better comprehensibility
- Build time has been reduced

## [2023-07-11 - Version 0.2.2](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.2)
Adding the `in`, `if`, `contains`, and `else` keywords.

**New Features**
- Added future keyword support to the runtime
- Added `in`, `if`, `contains`, and `else` keywords to the runtime
- Added partial set rule construction
- Added partial object rule construction

**Bug fixes**
- Else rule bodies were not previously handled correctly when the else keyword
  was omitted. This has been fixed.
- `ExprCall` nodes can now (correctly) be a `RefHead`.

**Improvements**
- Function calls are now represented interally via a `ExprCall` node as opposed to
  a `RefArgCall` node, to better reflect the target grammar.

## [2023-06-27 - Version 0.2.1](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.1)
Addressing various minor improvements, bugs, and documentation issues.

**Bug fixes**
- Fixed a segfault when an input, data, or module file did not exist
- Fixed a segfault when a lookdown returns zero definitions
- Fixed various typos and errors in the documentation
- Fixed a potential infinite rewrite loop in the RuleBody pass

**Improvements**
- Rule values will no longer always be `UnifyBody` nodes but will be `Term` nodes
  in cases when the rule returns a constant value.
- The code now uses the well-formed child indexing wherever possible for increased
  robustness.


## [2023-06-21 - Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/scenepic/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
